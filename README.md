The design uses CSS custom properties for easy theming:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #03A9F4;      /* Main brand color */
    --primary-dark: #0288D1;       /* Darker variant */

    --accent-color: #00BCD4;       /* Accent color */
    /* ... other variables */
}
```

Modify these values to change the color scheme while maintaining the Material Design aesthetic.
